# NakedAndAfraid
UHC scenario Naked and Afraid: you cannot see other player's armors 
This plugin pervents players from seeing each other's armor making them appear naked

I have been exprimenting with packets and this is a cool scenario
that is not hosted often enough and there is no public plugin
to my knowledge so I made one. 

This requires ProtocolLib and like most protocolLb plugins I would 
advise against using /reload (if you do make sure the scenario is disabled)
If you have any questions or issues please message me.

## Commands
/nakedandafraid enable  (enables the scenario)
/nakedandafraid disable (disables the scenario)

## Permissions
uhc.staff - to use /nakedandafraid command

## Follow up
There is no real reason to update this message; me if you have any issues.
Feel free to use this code for anything
